Quick description: Hectic to run since this is my first React full-stack project. 

Key points:
- Used Postgresql for the databases
- Fundamental(but not sound) system to store notecards (locker room system that I developed to link a batch of notecards to a "locker")
- Used Axios to connect front-end to back-end
- ExpressJS for Rest APIS

How to run (really not worth the time tbh): 
- The usual git clone and npm install
- Install Postgresql and configure the database, users, and tables
- Run the server index.js first
- npm run start to start the client side
- I hate myself
-
- jkjk
